VISION:
CouchPotato is an Arduino-controlled sculpture of a potato
watching television. It has an infrared sensor which allows
the piece to respond to a standard universal remote control.
When any button on the remote control is pressed, the potato
lifts an arm and points a miniature remote control which
is at the end of the arm at the remote television.
The piece is dark until the "Power On" button is pressed, at
which time the television lights up with both an RGB LED
and a flickering white LED (upcycled from an LED candle)
light up. When a "change channel" button is pressed, the
color of the RGB LED changes to indicate that there's a
different show and 4-digit 7-segment numeric display changes
to a random 4-digit number (10,000 channels and nothing's
on), and random brief audio clip plays.
