VISION:
CouchPotato is an Arduino-controlled sculpture of a potato
watching television. It has an infrared sensor which allows
the piece to respond to a standard universal remote control.
When any button on the remote control is pressed, the potato
lifts an arm and points a miniature remote control which
is at the end of the arm at the remote television. A tiny
LED on the miniature remote control lights up.
The piece is dark until the "Power On" button is pressed, at
which time the television lights up with both an RGB LED
and a flickering white LED (upcycled from an LED candle).
Alternatively, a miniature rectangular LCD display (e.g.
a Sparkfun graphic LCD 84 x 48 display) lights up.
When a "change channel" button is pressed, the
color of the RGB LED (or the graphic LCD display)
changes to indicate that there's a
different show and 4-digit 7-segment numeric display changes
to a random 4-digit number ("10,000 channels and nothing's
on") (optional: 7-segment display shows channel numbers
as pushed), and random brief audio clip plays.
